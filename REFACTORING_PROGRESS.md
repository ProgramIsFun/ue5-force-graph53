# KnowledgeGraph Refactoring Progress

> **📋 AI ASSISTANT CONTEXT FILE**  
> This document tracks the ongoing refactoring of the KnowledgeGraph class.  
> When resuming work on this refactoring, read this file first to understand current progress and next steps.

## Goal
Decompose the monolithic `AKnowledgeGraph` class into smaller, focused components for better maintainability and testability.

## Target Architecture
```
AKnowledgeGraph (orchestrator)
├── UGraphDataManager (data & HTTP)
├── UGraphPhysicsSimulator (force calculations)
├── UGraphRenderer (visualization)
├── FGraphOctreeManager (spatial queries)
└── UGraphInteractionHandler (user interaction)
```

## Completed Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Configuration Extraction
**Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Status:** COMPLETE - Compiles successfully  
**Tested:** Yes

**Changes:**
- Created `Source/NBodySimulation/GraphConfiguration.h`
- Introduced `FGraphConfiguration` struct with organized categories:
  - General Settings
  - Position Settings
  - Simulation Settings
  - Node Rendering Settings
  - Link Rendering Settings
  - Debug Settings
- Added `Config` property to `AKnowledgeGraph`
- Kept legacy properties for backward compatibility
- Renamed enum `CGM` → `EGraphCreationMode` (legacy enum kept)

**Benefits:**
- All configuration now in one place
- Better editor organization with proper categories
- Cleaner property names (e.g., `bUseGPUShaders` vs `use_shaders`)
- Foundation for future refactoring

**Files Modified:**
- `Source/NBodySimulation/KnowledgeGraph.h` (added Config struct, marked legacy properties)

**Files Created:**
- `Source/NBodySimulation/GraphConfiguration.h`

**Migration Path:**
- Old code still works: `use_shaders`, `universal_graph_scale`, etc.
- New code should use: `Config.bUseGPUShaders`, `Config.UniversalGraphScale`, etc.
- Legacy properties will be removed in future steps

### ✅ Step 2: Create GraphDataManager
**Date:** 2026-03-10  
**Status:** COMPLETE - Compiles successfully  
**Tested:** Compilation only (not yet integrated)

**Changes:**
- Created `UGraphDataManager` class to handle all data operations
- Introduced clean data structures:
  - `FNodeData` - Replaces messy `Node77` class
  - `FLinkData` - Replaces messy `Link77` class
- Extracted all HTTP request code from `KnowledgeGraph5.cpp`
- Extracted JSON parsing logic
- Implemented ID mapping system (string ↔ integer)
- Added delegate system for async operations (`FOnGraphDataLoaded`)
- Proper error handling and logging

**API Overview:**
```cpp
// Main operations
void RequestGraphData(EGraphCreationMode Mode, ...);
void AddNodeToDatabase(const FString& NodeName, const FVector& Location);
void UpdateAllNodePositionsToDatabase(const TArray<FVector>& Positions);

// Data access
const TArray<FNodeData>& GetNodes() const;
const TArray<FLinkData>& GetLinks() const;
int32 GetNodeIndexFromStringId(const FString& StringId) const;
```

**Benefits:**
- All HTTP/database code isolated in one class
- Clean separation of data from logic
- Easier to test data operations
- Better error handling
- Async operations with delegates

**Files Created:**
- `Source/NBodySimulation/GraphDataManager.h`
- `Source/NBodySimulation/GraphDataManager.cpp`

**Next Step:**
Before proceeding to Step 3, we should integrate GraphDataManager into KnowledgeGraph to verify it works correctly. This is optional but recommended.

## Pending Steps

### ⏸️ Step 2b: Integrate GraphDataManager (OPTIONAL)
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Dependencies:** Step 2 (complete)  
**Estimated Complexity:** Low

**Goal:** Wire up the new GraphDataManager in KnowledgeGraph to replace old data code

**What to do:**
- Add `UGraphDataManager* DataManager` property to `AKnowledgeGraph`
- Replace calls to old HTTP functions with DataManager API
- Bind to `OnGraphDataLoaded` delegate
- Test that graph loading still works

### ⏸️ Step 3: Create GraphPhysicsSimulator
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Dependencies:** Step 2 (complete)  
**Estimated Complexity:** High
**Goal:** Extract all HTTP, JSON, and database operations

**What to extract:**
- HTTP request functions (`request_graph_http`, `debug_error_request`)
- JSON parsing (`extracting_property_list_and_store`)
- Node/link data storage (`all_nodes2`, `all_links2`)
- ID mapping (`string_to_id`, `id_to_string`)
- Blueprint functions for database operations

**Files to create:**
- `Source/NBodySimulation/GraphDataManager.h`
- `Source/NBodySimulation/GraphDataManager.cpp`

**Expected outcome:**
- `AKnowledgeGraph` delegates all data operations to `UGraphDataManager`
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier to test data operations in isolation

### ⏸️ Step 3: Create GraphPhysicsSimulator
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Dependencies:** Step 2 (not started)  
**Estimated Complexity:** High

- Velocity/position updates
- Alpha decay logic
- Octree management for Barnes-Hut
- CPU vs GPU simulation switching

**Files to create:**
- `Source/NBodySimulation/GraphPhysicsSimulator.h`
- `Source/NBodySimulation/GraphPhysicsSimulator.cpp`

### ⏸️ Step 4: Create GraphRenderer

**What to extract:**
- Instanced mesh management

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium
**Goal:** Final polish

**Tasks:**
- Remove legacy properties

- Add documentation
- Remove commented code
- Consolidate `KnowledgeGraph2.cpp`, `KnowledgeGraph3.cpp`, `KnowledgeGraph5.cpp`

## 🤖 Instructions for AI Assistants

When resuming this refactoring:

1. **Read this file first** - Check the Progress Overview table to see what's done
2. **Verify compilation** - Ensure the project still compiles before making changes
3. **Follow the plan** - Complete steps in order (don't skip ahead)
4. **Update this file** - After each step, update status and add details
5. **Test incrementally** - Compile and test after each change
6. **Maintain compatibility** - Don't break existing code until Step 6

**Current state:** Steps 1-2 complete. Ready to begin Step 3 (GraphPhysicsSimulator) or integrate Step 2 into KnowledgeGraph.

## Notes

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- Keep legacy properties during migration
- Mark them as deprecated with comments
- Remove only after all code is migrated
- Ensure existing Blueprints continue to work

### Testing Strategy
- Compile after each step
- Test in editor after each step
- Verify existing functionality still works
- No breaking changes until final cleanup

### Code Style Improvements
- Use descriptive names (not `jnodessss`, `kn`, `ll`)
- Use `b` prefix for booleans (`bUseShaders` not `use_shaders`)
- Use proper categories in UPROPERTY
- Add comments for complex algorithms

## Questions/Decisions Log

**Q:** Should we merge KnowledgeGraph2/3/5.cpp into one file or split into components?  
**A:** Split into components (DataManager, PhysicsSimulator, Renderer) for better organization

**Q:** Keep legacy properties or force migration immediately?  
**A:** Keep for now, remove in Step 6 after full migration

**Q:** Use UObject or UActorComponent for new classes?  
**A:** UObject for managers (data, physics), UActorComponent for renderer/interaction
